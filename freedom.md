title: Freedom
---
We see tint as much more than just a place where agencies can help their clients easily maintain a beautifully designed website.  Tint is a platform that can power anything that calls itself a website.  And so it is too big to limit this platform to our own imagination or business ambitions.

Tint is built on freedom.  From the static site generators that enable what we do, to the libraries and programming languages Tint itself is built in, to the extensible backend infrastructure we use to run your builds, nothing we do would be possible without the freedoms we were given by many, many other projects.  We'd like to pass those freedoms on.
<h2 id="the-freedom-to-run-tint-yourself">The Freedom to Run Tint Yourself</h2>
We think that we provide a pretty good service here, and we'd love you to host your site with us.  But if you feel the need, for whatever reason, to run our software stack yourself, that will always be an option.  You never have to worry that we might get bored and stop offering the service, or sell our company and leave you high and dry, because *anyone can run a service on the same software that we use*.

Have a unique set of needs that the current platform just can't quite cover?  Instead of building a custom solution yourself, why not start with what we already have?  Take our code and extend it for whatever you or your clients require.  We'll even integrate some contributions back into the main platform so that others can benefit too!
<h2 id="the-freedom-to-take-your-site-with-you">The Freedom to Take Your Site With You</h2>
Tint sites are built using your choice of well-established tools that come with freedoms of their own.  All of your data is stored in a git repository under your control, and built into a website using tools that are freely-available from anywhere.  Even if you don't want to run all of Tint yourself, you can take your site and host it with any other platform that supports your static site generator of choice!  No lock-in here, we respect your right to your own site that you've worked so hard to build.

Some companies talk about freedom as a marketing gimmick, but we really believe it.  There is no "Enterprise Edition" that gives you more features at the expense of freedom.  All contributions to the platform are owned by the original, individual, authors (including the founders!) so there is no assignment or CLA with a corporate entity that can change the terms later.  All core platform code is licensed under the AGPLv3 to keep us all honest.
